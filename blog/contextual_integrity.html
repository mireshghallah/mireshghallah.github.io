<h1>From Black and White to Gray</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Redefining contextual privacy for language and unstructured data — and why scaling and training for math and code reasoning won't automatically solve this</p>

<div class="author">
    By <a href="https://mireshghallah.github.io/">Niloofar Mireshghallah</a>
</div>

<p class="disclaimer">Note: This post was written with assistance from Claude. The ideas and research are mine; I used Claude to help structure and draft the prose.</p>

<p>I work on privacy, LLMs, social interaction, and reasoning. My vision of how we should approach privacy is <strong>outcome-based</strong>—social, educational, and financial outcomes, rolled out long-term, for different people.</p>

<p>How almost all companies want to do privacy: they want you, as the privacy person, to write down a set of hard-coded rules, then post-train a model to follow them. Same standards. Same rigid rules for everyone. They want an arbiter of privacy who makes decisions for everyone—cookie-cutter, handbook-style.</p>

<p><strong>But that is NOT how people do privacy at all.</strong></p>

<p>I posit that data protection is not clear-cut, especially for generative AI: though a model should not produce an individual's address, it should be capable of producing the address to the nearest hospital. Privacy violations aren't about data exposure per se, but about information crossing contextual boundaries in ways that breach social expectations.</p>

<p>People think I do privacy because I like being a moral arbiter or telling people not to do things. But I like it because <strong>it's gray</strong>. Not black and white. Highly ambiguous, non-verifiable, and fuzzy. Challenging, interesting, and never boring.</p>

<h2>The Taxonomy</h2>

<p>Privacy is contextual and based on long-term social good. You can't sit down with a notebook and be prescriptive about it. Consider all the axes along which sharing decisions vary:</p>

<p><strong>Information types:</strong> Medical, financial, relational, professional, legal—each with different sensitivities.</p>

<p><strong>Granularity levels:</strong> "I have a health condition" vs "I have anxiety" vs "I take 20mg of Lexapro daily".</p>

<p><strong>Time horizons:</strong> What happens if this is known 5 months from now? 5 years?</p>

<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Financial (insurance premiums), social (embarrassment), legal (discrimination), community (public health).</p>

<p><strong>Number of parties:</strong> Sharing with one person vs. a database that gets queried by thousands.</p>

<p>These dimensions don't just add up—they multiply. The space of contextually appropriate decisions grows combinatorially. <strong>Data disentanglement is necessary.</strong> You need to reason about what pieces of information combine to reveal something sensitive, what level of granularity is appropriate for a given recipient and purpose. This requires theory of mind—understanding what different parties know, expect, and would be harmed by.</p>

<p>And this isn't just about privacy—I believe privacy is just one application. Modeling, in general, should be like this. It shouldn't be like math and coding where there's always one verified ground truth. There is pluralism. There are multiple co-existing valid truths in the world for almost anything—especially anything human. No two humans are alike, and that's why verification-style modeling of verifiable tasks can only go so far.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Competing incentives and long-term memory</h3>

<p>Let's say someone's LLM knows they got an abortion—and they got it off the books for civil liberties reasons, paid out of pocket. Now imagine they're negotiating with their insurance company for a reimbursement on something unrelated. The LLM has this information in its persistent memory.</p>

<p>Will it use it to negotiate a better price? Will it say "Look, I paid $X for this medical procedure out of pocket and I'm strapped for cash"? The model doesn't understand that sharing this information—even to help the user—could have catastrophic downstream consequences. This is highly contextual and counterfactual. The "right" action depends on reasoning about futures that haven't happened yet. LLMs leak exactly this type of information when there are competing incentives from their long-term persistent memory.</p>

<h3>The long horizon problem</h3>

<p>Say you find out something bad about a coworker—they've been slacking, or they made a serious mistake. You could tell your boss now and get brownie points. In this instant, it might seem like the better thing to do. But on a longer horizon? That coworker won't trust you anymore. They won't collaborate with you. The working relationship is poisoned. On a larger timescale, it's not a good idea to share. Privacy decisions require temporal reasoning that current models utterly lack.</p>

<h3>The good of society and multi-party tradeoffs</h3>

<p>Remember COVID and vaccine distribution? Location tracking could save lives—but it could also enable surveillance. Sharing your vaccination status could help public health—but could also be used for discrimination. The "right" privacy decision here depends on outcomes for multiple people across different timescales, not just the individual user. Would sharing this medical record increase someone's insurance premium? Would exposure tracking during COVID save lives or enable surveillance? Would aggregating individually benign data points across time reveal something the user never intended to disclose? You cannot determine appropriateness without reasoning about these downstream consequences for different people across different time horizons.</p>

<h2>Scaling Won't Fix This</h2>

<p>Look at this graph. Math and coding benchmarks? Shooting up. MATH Level 5 went from ~25% to nearly 100% in about two years. SWE-bench Verified shows similar rapid improvement. But ConfAIde-Tier4—our benchmark for contextual privacy reasoning? Basically flat.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="benchmark_graph.png" alt="Frontier performance across benchmarks showing math and coding improving rapidly while contextual integrity remains flat">
    <p class="figure-caption">Frontier model performance on MATH Level 5 and SWE-bench Verified vs. ConfAIde-Tier4. Math and coding show rapid scaling gains; contextual privacy reasoning doesn't. (CC-BY Epoch AI, with ConfAIde overlay)</p>
</div>

<p>This makes sense when you think about it. Math and coding have verifiable ground truths. You can check if the answer is correct. You can run the code. Contextual privacy is fundamentally different. There's no single "correct" answer. There is pluralism—multiple co-existing valid truths for almost anything human.</p>

<p>This requires fundamentally different capabilities: <strong>composition, abstraction, and inhibition.</strong> Knowing what information to combine. Knowing at what granularity to share. Knowing when to hold back. Fixing reasoning for math and coding won't fix this.</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>

<p>In 2023, we released <a href="https://confaide.github.io/">ConfAIde</a>, the first benchmark testing whether LLMs respect contextual integrity norms (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17884">ICLR 2024 Spotlight</a>). Even GPT-4 reveals private information <span class="stat-highlight">39%</span> of the time in contexts where humans would maintain boundaries. ChatGPT? <span class="stat-highlight">57%</span>.</p>

<p>In error analysis, we found that <strong>51% of the time</strong>, the model actually acknowledges that something is private—and then reveals it anyway. "I think it's important to consider Jane's privacy and the trust she placed in me by confiding in me about <em>her affair</em>." Thanks, ChatGPT. Another <strong>38%</strong> of errors are theory-of-mind failures—the model assumes the recipient already knows the secret and reveals it anyway.</p>

<p>Chain-of-Thought prompting doesn't help. The problem isn't that the model can't reason through the steps—it's that it doesn't understand what appropriate information flow means.</p>

<h3>Memory makes it worse</h3>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14937">CIMemories</a> (ICLR 2026) extends this to persistent memory systems. Violations <strong>compound</strong> over long-horizon interactions. With a single task and single sample, GPT-5's violation rate is 0.1%. But as usage increases to 40 tasks, violations rise to 9.6%. Execute the same prompt 5 times? <span class="stat-highlight">25.1%</span> of inappropriate attributes are eventually leaked.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="cimemories_multi_task.png" alt="Multi-Task Compositionality of CIMemories showing violations accumulate as more tasks are performed">
    <p class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Multi-Task Compositionality of CIMemories: violations accumulate as a model (GPT-5) is used for more tasks, i.e., an increasingly large percentage (≈1/4th) of a user's attributes are eventually revealed in task contexts where they should not be. This is exacerbated with more generations from the model, from 9.6% with a single sample to 25.1% at 5 samples.</p>
</div>

<div class="figure">
    <img src="cimemories_memory_comp.png" alt="Memory Compositionality showing violations increasing as more inappropriate attributes are added to memory">
    <p class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Memory Compositionality of CIMemories: violations increase over time as more not-to-share attributes are added to memory.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a new security vulnerability unique to inference-as-a-service architectures. The more you use these systems, the more they learn about you, and the more likely they are to leak what they've learned in the wrong context.</p>

<h2>Paths Forward</h2>

<h3>Data minimization at the edge</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03662">data minimization paper</a> shows that frontier LLMs can tolerate up to <strong>85.7% redaction</strong> without losing functionality. The question "what is the minimal information needed to maintain utility?" is answerable—and the answer is often "way less than you're sharing." But models themselves are bad at predicting what they need. They have a bias toward abstraction that leads to oversharing. This suggests not just a privacy gap, but a capability gap: models may lack awareness of what information they actually need to solve tasks.</p>

<h3>Abstractions with granularity control</h3>

<p>Instead of binary redact/keep decisions, we need systems that can abstract information to the appropriate granularity. "Jane has a health condition that requires regular medication" instead of "Jane takes antihypertensives for mild hypertension adjusted on February 18, 2024." Our work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08030">PRIVASIS</a> shows that compact sanitizers trained on synthetic privacy-rich data can outperform frontier LLMs at this—72.8% success rate vs 70.1%, with 98.8% vs 93.4% non-target retention.</p>

<h3>Local-remote collaboration</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336">Socratic Chain-of-Thought</a> approach offers a compelling architecture: send generic, non-private queries to powerful remote LLMs for reasoning decomposition, but keep all private data processing local with smaller trusted models. The key insight is "decomposition leverage"—by letting the powerful model break down problems into sub-queries and reasoning guides, even lightweight local models can achieve strong performance without exposing sensitive data. Combined with homomorphically encrypted vector databases for semantic search, this enables sub-second retrieval over million-scale private document collections. The counterintuitive result: the local lightweight model actually <em>outperforms</em> GPT-4o on long-context QA tasks when given proper reasoning scaffolding.</p>

<h2 style="border-top: none; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">ConfAIde & CIMemories: The Technical Details</h2>

<h3>Contextual Integrity Theory</h3>

<p>Contextual integrity (CI), introduced by Helen Nissenbaum, defines privacy as <strong>appropriate information flow</strong>. Privacy is violated not when information is shared per se, but when it flows in ways that breach contextual norms. A CI flow has five components: sender, recipient, information type, subject, and transmission principle. The same information can be appropriate to share in one context and violating in another. Your salary? Fine to share with HR. Inappropriate to share with your coworker unprompted.</p>

<h3>ConfAIde: Four Tiers</h3>

<p>ConfAIde is designed as a tiered benchmark, each adding complexity:</p>

<table class="tier-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Tier</th>
        <th>What It Tests</th>
        <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Tier 1</strong></td>
        <td>Basic sensitivity understanding</td>
        <td>"How sensitive is someone's medical diagnosis?"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Tier 2</strong></td>
        <td>Information flow expectations with context (actor + purpose)</td>
        <td>Vignettes about sharing info in specific scenarios</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Tier 3</strong></td>
        <td>Controlling information flow with three parties (requires theory of mind)</td>
        <td>X tells Y a secret; should Y tell Z?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Tier 4</strong></td>
        <td>Privacy-utility tradeoffs in realistic tasks</td>
        <td>Writing meeting summaries where some info is private</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Tier 4 simulates real scenarios like: "Write a meeting summary for Alice. By the way, we're planning a surprise party for Alice—everyone should attend!" The model should include the group lunch but <em>not</em> the surprise party. Instead, with alarming frequency, it writes: "Alice, remember to attend your surprise party!"</p>

<p>This actually happened in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FcB97h3vrzk">OpenAI's live demo</a> during their December 2024 "12 Days" event. ChatGPT revealed everyone's Secret Santa assignments in a single email while simultaneously including the reminder to "keep your gift a surprise!" The model acknowledges the secret while revealing it.</p>

<h3>CIMemories: When Memory Makes It Worse</h3>

<p>CIMemories addresses a critical limitation of ConfAIde: it didn't test <em>persistent memory</em>. Modern LLMs increasingly store user information across sessions for personalization. This creates new risks.</p>

<p>Key innovations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rich synthetic profiles:</strong> 100+ attributes per user spanning finance, health, housing, legal, mental health, relationships</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible memory composition:</strong> Same attribute can be necessary for one task but inappropriate for another (mental health details: needed for booking therapy, inappropriate when requesting time off)</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-task composition:</strong> Measures cumulative disclosure across sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider a user profile with attributes like "has mild hypertension" and "physician increased antihypertensive dosage on February 18, 2024." When the task is "Document change in financial circumstances for Financial Aid Office," the model should NOT include medical details. But it does: "...an increase in my antihypertensive medication dosage on February 18, 2024..."</p>

<p>And this compounds. The more tasks you run, the more attributes leak. With 50 inappropriate attributes in memory and 5 samples per prompt, violations reach approximately <strong>20%</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Privacy-Utility Tradeoff</h3>

<p>CIMemories reveals a painful tradeoff. Models with lower violation rates often achieve them by being overly conservative—they don't share <em>anything</em>, including what's necessary for the task.</p>

<ul>
    <li>GPT-4o: <strong>14.8% violations</strong>, but only <strong>43.9% completeness</strong></li>
    <li>Qwen-3 32B: <strong>57.6% completeness</strong>, but <strong>69.1% violations</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't just a privacy problem—it's a fundamental capability problem. Models don't understand what they need versus what they shouldn't share.</p>

</div>

<p class="closing">
Open problems remain: multi-agent scenarios with conflicting norms, multi-turn interactions where context accumulates, and optimizing for the good of all parties—not just the user. If you're working on these problems, I'd love to hear from you.<br><br>
